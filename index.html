            <p>The even takes place from 2019-05-31 to 2019-06-02 at the
              <a href="">Glungezer H&uuml;tte</a> (lodge) near Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria.
              The lodge is reachable only by foot.</p>

            <p>And here is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mdw.ag/camglungezer/glungezer_talblick.jpg">webcam</a>
               showing the current weather situation.</p>

            <p>In case the weather or snow condition do not allow us to go the logde
              we stay in Innsbruck. We will arrange the hotel and meeting location
              if that is the case.<p>

              <h3>Travel</h3>
            <p>The closest airport is
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.innsbruck-airport.com">Innsbruck</a>.
              Another option is the airport in
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.munich-airport.de">Munich</a> which is approx. 2 hours
              by car from Innsbruck.</p>

            <h3>Hotels</h3>
            <p>Since the lodge is a few hours by foot from civilization, staying at the
              lodge strongly recommended. ;)</p>

            <p>First and most important: yes there is power available and we will
              have a WiFi hotspot. It will not be fast, but checking for some emails it
              should be okay.</p>

            <p>You should have a pair of good hiking shoes (This is really
              important!). It is not a difficult path just in case the weather is
              nasty. Also a rain jacket is thing to bring with you.</p>

            <p>It also a good idea to bring your own sleeping bag. If you don't have
              one it is not a problem.  There are blankets available at the lodge
              but usually they are not washed after each usage...</p>

            <p>A hiking backpack should be enough to bring cloths and other equipment
              with you for 3 days.</p>

            <p>Food and drinks are available at the lodge. The hike to the lodge is around
              2 hours (7 km). So it is not particular long but you might want to bring some
              drinking or food with you.</p>
